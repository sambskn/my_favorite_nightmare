## Day 1

Made a good deal of progress for the first day thanks to starting from my bevy_trench_template project. I started by making a few fresh textures and sounds after finding out about the theme, **"Extremely Incohesive Fever Dream"**. Made some vibey pads for a quick BGM and intro stinger, and also recorded some foley 'squelch' noises for the walking around SFX. That squelchiness matches up with te sort of fleshy texture I made.

The final initial environment I got set up has a vibe. Made a kinda grave thing you spawn in (good idea Joe!), and there's some lighting nodes with big ol wires noodling through the kind of womb esque environment. Also Rat sprite is there lol.

Having trouble getting picking to work the way I'd like...

It sorta works from some angles with the rat, but idk why only from some angles...

Anyway, would be cool to get a few more basic elements constructed so I can really get to level making. I think that list is:
- Picking, like mentioned above, pretty key to get "press button to verb the highlighted object" stuff working
  - I did just do a simple material where I just added a color, doing an outline would probably be better with a separate sprite.
- Level gates/keys

Let's see!
